Both Weber and Schumpeter display a strong fascination and elaboration with the work of Marx. The way they analyze Marx is very revealing about the way contemporary analysts seek to understand the capitalist system. We will also consider a number of current efforts that look at the systemic nature of capitalism. In particular, we are interested in how economic historians now see the development of capitalism.

The implications of viewing individuals as equal and endowed with certain rights is potentially far reaching as in the declaration that individuals hold many of those rights irrespective of the views of their government. Yet, we also live in a world of sovereign states with sovereign state's rights. We see everyday a clash between the rights of the individual and lack of duty to fulfill those rights when an individual's home state is unwilling or unable to do so. After introducing the idea of human rights, its historic development and various international human rights mechanisms, this course will ask what post-World War II conceptions of human rights mean for a number of specific issues including humanitarian intervention, international criminal justice, U.S. foreign policy, immigration, and economic rights. Looking in-depth at these five areas, we will ask how ideas about human rights, laws about human rights, and institutions to protect human rights have on how states and other global actors act, and how individuals have fared."}, "VIS SCI 300": {"course_num": "300", "title": "Teaching Methods in Vision Science", "dept_name_full": "Vision Science", "dept_code": "VIS SCI", "desc": "Instruction in teaching methods and materials, in vision science and optometry; practice teaching in classrooms and laboratory."}, "AFRICAM C375": {"course_num": "C375", "title": "Critical Pedagogy: Instructor Training", "dept_name_full": "African American Studies", "dept_code": "AFRICAM", "desc": "The seminar provides a systemic approach to theories and practices of critical pedagogy at the university level.
