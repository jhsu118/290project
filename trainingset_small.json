The way they analyze Marx is very revealing about the way contemporary analysts seek to understand the capitalist system.

Case studies explore issues such as urban entrepreneurialism and the branding of cities and nation-states; heritage practices and the postcolonial politics of place; border cities, and the urbanism of transnational production; cities, terrorism and the global architecture of security; critical regionalism, localism and other responses to debates on place and placelessness.

Participants in the course will become acquainted with nutritional research, policies, and interventions designed to enhance reproduction, growth, and development. This course will also explore health disparities in maternal and child nutrition in both a domestic and international context."}, "SOC WEL 210B": {"title": "Infant Development", "dept_name_full": "Social Welfare", "dept_code": "SOC WEL", "unique_words": ["and", "assessment", "behavior", "development", "disturbance", "health", "high", "in", "including", "infant", "infants", "intervention", "issues", "mental", "of", "parentchild", "predictors", "relationships", "risk", "topics", "with"], "course_num": "210B", "desc": "Topics and issues in infant development, including infant mental health, parent-child relationships, behavior assessment, predictors of disturbance, and intervention with high risk infants."}, "SPANISH 200B": {"title": "Research Seminar I", "dept_name_full": "Spanish", "dept_code": "SPANISH", "unique_words": ["abstracts", "academic", "and", "applying", "book", "central", "conferencelength", "conferences", "consists", "cultural", "debates", "developing", "different", "faculty", "for", "function", "genres", "identify", "in", "interests", "introduce", "introduces", "it", "literary", "mastery", "mentors", "objective", "of", "papers", "portuguese", "position", "potential", "precis", "questions", "research", "reviews", "second", "seminar", "spanish", "strategies", "students", "studies", "the", "this", "to", "will", "write"], "course_num": "200B", "desc": "This research seminar introduces students to central questions and debates in literary and cultural studies in Spanish and Portuguese.
